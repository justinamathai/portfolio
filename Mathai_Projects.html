       <li>Duration: September 19, 2017 - October 4, 2017</li>
       <li>Course: CSE (Computer Science Engineering)</li>
       <li>Type of Project: Partnered project</li>
      </ul>
      <p1>The main goal of this project was to create an app that is fun and easy to play with. 
       My partner and I decided to make an app where there is a flying saucer in space and the play 
       controls the spaceship that shoots rockets. The objective of the game is to get as many points 
       as the player can in under a certain amount of time by shooting the saucer. This project was used 
       to show us how to invent an app and how to work with different code blocks. My partner and I both 
       learned how to make the codes and different characters for the game.</p1>

      <h3>The A-MAZE-ing Game</h3>
      <ul>
       <li>Duration: September 1, 2017 - September 7, 2017</li>
       <li>Course: CSE (Computer Science Engineering)</li>
       <li>Type of Project: Partnered project</li>
       </ul>
       <p2>The purpose of this project is to make a game that is enjoyable and challenges the player. My partner 
       and I decided to make a game where there are three levels of difficulty of a maze. The objective of the game 
       is to get the character to the end of the maze without touching any of the walls. If the character hits the 
       wall then the player will have to restart that level. This project was used to help us understand how detailed 
       we need to be and the basic building blocks of a game. We figured out what different codes meant and how to make 
       the perfect game.</p2>
