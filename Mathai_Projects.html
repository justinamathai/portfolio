       <li>Course: CSE (Computer Science Engineering)</li>
       <li>Type of Project: Partnered project</li>
      </ul>
      <p1>The main goal of this project was to create an app that is fun and easy to play with. 
       My partner and I decided to make an app where there is a flying saucer in space and the play 
       controls the spaceship that shoots rockets. The objective of the game is to get as many points 
       as the player can in under a certain amount of time by shooting the saucer. This project was used 
       to show us how to invent an app and how to work with different code blocks. My partner and I both 
       learned how to make the codes and different characters for the game.</p1>

      <h3>The A-MAZE-ing Game</h3>
      <ul>
       <li>Duration: September 1, 2017 - September 7, 2017</li>
       <li>Course: CSE (Computer Science Engineering)</li>
       <li>Type of Project: Partnered project</li>
       </ul>
       <p2>The purpose of this project is to make a game that is enjoyable and challenges the player. My partner 
       and I decided to make a game where there are three levels of difficulty of a maze. The objective of the game 
       is to get the character to the end of the maze without touching any of the walls. If the character hits the 
       wall then the player will have to restart that level. This project was used to help us understand how detailed 
       we need to be and the basic building blocks of a game. We figured out what different codes meant and how to make 
       the perfect game.</p2>

      <h3>Hangman</h3>
      <ul>
       <li>Duration: January 24, 2018 - February 1, 2018</li>
       <li>Course: CSE (Computer Science Engineering)</li>
       <li>Type of Project: Partnered project</li>
       </ul>
       <p2> The game is a normal hangman game that you would play with your friends exept it is controlled by coding. My partner and I 
       decided to make the theme of our hangman game about animals. In our code we included numbers of animals that we thought of. The objective
       is to guess the word, letter by letter, until the number of guesses run out. The project was used to help us understand what is needed to 
       make this hangman game possible and to try out new and different codes. We had to fix some of our code if it didn't work because otherwise
       the game wouldn't have worked.</p2>

      <h3>Image Manipulation</h3>

       <p2> This project is where we took several images in ou sketch and made a poster type thing relates to our cause. Our cause is to help with 
       animal shelters and how they should get adopted more. This is made out of coding from python. We included different pets and lined them up 
       in order and added wording to the poster to make it look professional so that people can believe in our cause. This project helped us understand
       how to use PIL and line pictures in a certain order. It also taught us to combine all sorts of pictures together and cropping them to make it 
       all fit in the same size. </p2>
