      <p1>Hello, my name is Justina Mathai and I am a Freshman at Dublin High School. 
      My career that I am aiming towards is somewhere in the medical field. More specifically, being a pediatrician. 
      I want to be a pediatrician because I love having to work with little kids and I want to help them be healthy. 
      I am planning on taking a lot of subjects related to biology and science. 
      The college that I want to go to is UC Davis because one of my siblings went there and it looks like a lot of fun.</p> 
      <p2>I have learned a lot about myself for the past years of my life. 
      For example, I took my first dance class when I was about 4 years old, and I realized I am a good dancer. 
      Whenever my dance group enters a competition we are very competitive, so we make sure we are going to be very energetic and strong with our movements and practice everyday. 
      I have also joined a basketball team in 6th grade and quickly realized that basketball is not something I would want to do in the future.</p>
      <p3>Since this is my first year in high school, I have not made any major accomplishment yet. 
      Some clubs that I have joined are technical theater, BuildOn, and badminton. 
      The club I really get excited for is technical theater because I have always wanted to help out with school plays or events that happen. If there are futher more questions
      please feel free to contact me!</p>
